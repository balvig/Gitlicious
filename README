= Gitlicious

Gitlicious gathers metrics about your commits and tells you where you suck


= Installation

- clone the repository
- cp config/database.sample.yml config/database.yml
- bundle install
- bundle exec rake db:migrate
- script/rails server


= Usage

Create a new project. You must give the project a path where you have cloned another project.

DANGER:
Gitlicious will play nasty games with your git repository, DON'T use a directory you are working on. Clone the project in a different directory for unique and exclusive Gitlicious joy.

update the project, this will take forever, it is fine, go to the console to see how it works if you need entertainment.
It will take really long time. Hours...

= Requirements
- Rails 3.0.x
- Ruby 1.8.7
- Bundler
- Whatever the Gemfile says
